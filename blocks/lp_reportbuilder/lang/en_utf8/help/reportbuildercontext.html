<h1>Restrict Access by Role</h1>
<p>Context is the location or level within the system that the user has access to. For example a Site Administrator would have System level access (context), while a learner may only have Course level access (context).</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong> allows you to set the context in which a user has been assigned a role to view the report.</p>
<p>A user can be assigned a role at the system level giving them site wide access or just within a particular context. For instance a trainer may only be assigned the role at the course level.</p>
<p>When <strong>Users must have role in the system context</strong> is selected the user must be assigned the role at a system level (i.e. at a site-wide level) to be able to view the report.</p>
<p>When <strong>User may have role in any context</strong> is selected a user can view the report when they have been assigned the selected role anywhere in the system.</p>
