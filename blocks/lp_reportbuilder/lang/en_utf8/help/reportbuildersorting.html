<h1>Sorting</h1>
<p><strong>Sorting</strong> allows you to set a default column and sort order on a report.</p>
<p>A user is still able to manually sort a report while viewing it. The users preferences will be saved during the active session. When they finish the session the report will return to the default sort settings set here.</p>
