<h1>Report Builder: Show by course tag</h1>

<p>This criteria is enabled by selecting the 'Show records by course tag' checkbox. If selected, the report will show results based on whether the record belongs to a course that is tagged with particular tags.</p>
<p>If any tags in the 'Include records tagged with' section are selected, only records belonging to a course tagged with all the selected tags will be shown. Records belonging to courses with no tags will <strong>not</strong> be shown.</p>
<p>If any tags in the 'Exclude records tagged with' section are selected, records belonging to a coures tagged with the selected tags will <strong>not</strong> be shown. All records belonging to courses without any tags will be shown.</p>
<p>It is possible to include and exclude tags at the same time, but a single tag cannot be both included and excluded.</p>
