<h1>Source</h1>
<p>The <strong>Source</strong> of a report defines the primary type of data used. Further filtering options are available once you start editing the report.</p>
<p>Once saved, the report source cannot be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If no options are available in the <strong>Source</strong> field, or the source you require does not appear you will need your Totara installation to be configured to include the source data you require (This cannot be done via the Totara interface).</p>
