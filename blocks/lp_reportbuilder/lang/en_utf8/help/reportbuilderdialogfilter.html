<h1>Report Builder: Dialog filter</h1>
<p>This filter allows you to filter information based on a hierarchy. The filter has the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>is any value - this option disables the filter (i.e. all information is accepted by this filter)</li>
<li>is equal to - this option allows only information that is equal to the value selected from the list</li>
<li>is not equal to - this option allows only information that is different from the value selected from the list</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a framework item has been selected you can use the 'Include children?' checkbox to choose whether to match only that item, or match that item and any sub-items belonging to that item.</p>
