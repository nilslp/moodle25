<h1>Columns</h1>
<p><strong>Report Columns</strong> allows you to customise the columns that appear on your report. The available columns are determined by the data<strong>Source</strong> of the report. Each report source has a set of default columns set up.</p>
<p>Columns can be added, removed, renamed and sorted.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Columns: </strong>To add a new column to the report choose the required column from the 'Add another column...' dropdown list and click <strong>Save changes</strong>. The new column will be added to the end of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can only create one column of each type within a single report. You will receive a validation error if you try to include the same column more than once.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding columns: </strong>By default all columns appear when a user views the report. Use the 'show/hide' button (the eye icon) to hide columns you do not want users to see by default.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A hidden column is still available to a user viewing the report. Delete columns (the cross icon) that you do not want users to see at all.</p>
<p><strong>Moving columns: </strong>The columns will appear on the report in the order they are listed. Use the up and down arrows to change the order. </p>
<p><strong>Deleting columns: </strong>Click the 'Delete' button (the cross icon) to the right of the report column to remove that column from the report.</p>
<p><strong>Renaming columns: </strong>You can customise the name of a column by changing the <strong>Heading</strong> name and clicking <strong>Save changes</strong>. The <strong>Heading</strong> is the name that will appear on the report.</p>
<p><strong>Changing multiple column types: </strong>You can modify multiple column types at the same time by selecting a different column from the dropdown menu and clicking <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p>
