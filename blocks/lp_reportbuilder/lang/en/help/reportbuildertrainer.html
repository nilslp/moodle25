<h1>Report Builder: Show by trainer</h1>

<p>This criteria is enabled by selecting the 'Show records by trainer' checkbox. If selected, then the report will show different records depending on who the face-to-face trainer was for the feedback being given.</p>
<p>If 'Show records where the user is the trainer' is selected, the report will show feedback for sessions where the user viewing the report was the trainer.</p>
<p>If 'Records where one of the user's direct reports is the trainer' is selected, then the report will show records for sessions trained by staff of the person viewing the report.</p>
<p>If 'Both' is selected, then both of the above records will be shown.</p>
