<h1>Access Mode</h1>
<p>Access controls are used to restrict which users can view the report.</p>
<p><strong>Restrict access</strong> sets the overall access setting for the report.</p>
<p>When set to <strong>All users can view this report</strong> there are no restrictions applied to the report and all users will be able to view the report.</p>
<p>When set to <strong>Only certain users can view this report</strong> the report will be restricted to the user groups selected below.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> access restrictions only control who can view the report, not which records it contains. See the 'Content' tab for controlling the report contents.</p>
